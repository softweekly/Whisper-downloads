## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "File not found" Error
**Problem:** Can't find your video file
**Solution:** 
1. Check the file path is correct
2. Use full path: `C:\Users\YourName\Videos\video.mp4`
3. Make sure file extension is included (.mp4, .avi, etc.)

### "Permission denied" Error
**Problem:** Can't write to output folder
**Solution:**
1. Choose a different output folder (like Desktop)
2. Run as Administrator: Right-click `start.bat` → "Run as administrator"

### Very Slow Processing
**Problem:** Taking too long to process
**Solution:**
1. Use smaller model: Choose option 1 (tiny) instead of 2 (base)
2. Split long videos into shorter segments
3. Close other programs to free up memory

### Poor Transcription Quality
**Problem:** Text doesn't match what's said
**Solution:**
1. Use larger model: Choose option 4 (medium) or 5 (large)
2. Improve audio quality if possible
3. Check if language is English (tool is optimized for English)

### "Module not found" Error
**Problem:** Python can't find required packages
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in the right folder
2. Use the virtual environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Restart and try Method 1 (Interactive Mode)

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Small:** Try a short 1-2 minute video first to test everything works
2. **Good Audio:** Clear, loud audio gives much better transcription results
3. **Specific Keywords:** Search for specific terms, not common words like "the" or "and"
4. **File Naming:** Use descriptive names for your videos for easier organization
5. **Save Space:** Delete the temporary audio files after processing (they're automatically cleaned up)
6. **Model Choice:** 
   - Use 'tiny' for quick tests
   - Use 'base' for most videos (good balance)
   - Use 'medium' or 'large' for important/difficult audio
