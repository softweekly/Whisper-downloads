# Videos to Transcribe

Place your video files in this folder to make them easy to find and transcribe.

## How to use:

1. Copy or move your video files to this folder
2. Run the transcription app (`transcribe.bat` or `start.bat`)
3. Choose "local" when prompted
4. Enter the filename (or full path) when asked

## Supported video formats:
- MP4
- AVI
- MOV
- MKV
- WMV
- FLV
- WebM
- M4V

## Example:
If you place a file called `my_video.mp4` in this folder, you can enter:
- Just: `my_video.mp4`
- Or full path: `videos_to_transcribe\my_video.mp4`
- Or absolute path: `C:\Users\Soft\Desktop\Dev3\Whisper downloads\videos_to_transcribe\my_video.mp4`

Your transcribed files will be saved in the same folder as the video by default.
