# cookies.txt - Example File for YouTube Authentication
# 
# This file is used to access member-only or private YouTube content
# that you have permission to view.
#
# HOW TO CREATE YOUR cookies.txt FILE:
# 
# METHOD 1 - Browser Extension (EASIEST):
# ----------------------------------------
# 1. Install a cookies export extension:
#    - Chrome/Edge: Search for "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" in Chrome Web Store
#    - Firefox: Search for "cookies.txt" in Firefox Add-ons
# 
# 2. Log into YouTube in your browser
# 
# 3. Go to youtube.com
# 
# 4. Click the extension icon and export cookies
# 
# 5. Save the exported file as "cookies.txt" in this folder
#    (remove .example from the filename)
#
#
# METHOD 2 - Manual Export (ADVANCED):
# -------------------------------------
# 1. Open your browser and go to youtube.com (logged in)
# 
# 2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
# 
# 3. Go to Application/Storage tab → Cookies → youtube.com
# 
# 4. Export all cookies to a text file in Netscape format
# 
# 5. Save as "cookies.txt" in this folder
#
#
# WHAT THE FILE SHOULD LOOK LIKE:
# --------------------------------
# The cookies.txt file should be in Netscape cookie format:
#
# # Netscape HTTP Cookie File
# .youtube.com	TRUE	/	TRUE	0	CONSENT	YES+cb
# .youtube.com	TRUE	/	FALSE	1234567890	SID	your_session_id_here
# ... (more cookie lines)
#
#
# SECURITY WARNINGS:
# ------------------
# ⚠️  Keep cookies.txt PRIVATE - it contains your login session
# ⚠️  Don't share cookies.txt - it's like sharing your password
# ⚠️  Update periodically - cookies expire after weeks/months
# ⚠️  Delete when done - remove cookies.txt if no longer needed
#
#
# WHEN YOU NEED THIS FILE:
# ------------------------
# - Accessing member-only channel content
# - Downloading videos from your private playlists
# - Transcribing content from channels you're subscribed to
# - Any YouTube content that requires being logged in
#
#
# HOW THE APP USES IT:
# --------------------
# - The app automatically detects cookies.txt in this folder
# - No extra configuration needed
# - You'll see "✓ Using cookies.txt for authentication" when it's found
# - Works for both individual videos and channel transcription
#
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# ----------------
# If it's not working:
# - Make sure file is named exactly "cookies.txt" (not cookies.txt.txt)
# - Re-export fresh cookies while logged into YouTube
# - Verify you actually have access to the content
# - Check that cookies haven't expired (re-export if old)
#
#
# Once you have your real cookies.txt file, delete or rename this
# example file to avoid confusion.
